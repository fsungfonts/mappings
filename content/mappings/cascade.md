The sources used in the mappings are organised into three tiers, each with a
different level of verifiability.

- **Tier 1:** BZ, SY, Huang2, Yang3
  - **Tier 2:** FN, GLK
    - **Tier 3:** GZH, HZH
      - **Tier 4:** DCCV, GHZR

**Tier 1** includes studies where each citation of a glyph can be reliably
traced to primary evidence. **Tier 2** consists of dictionaries where primary
evidence cannot be easily verified. **Tier 3** dictionaries cite from both
primary evidence and pre-modern dictionaries. **Tier 4** can be thought of as
_dictionary of dictionaries_, which cite glyphs exclusively from other
dictionaries.
